			<p class="intro">My name is Josh Wehner. I got married last July to my beautiful wife, Marissa. I have been going to college since 2007, but I never have considered myself to be a true college student as I have always worked full time and gone to school part time.</p>		
			<p class="work-experience">I work for a car finance company and my job title is a Middleware Administrator. I started working in IT a little over 5 years ago. I have an Associate's Degree from Monroe County Community College and I am almost done with my Bachelor's Degree from UT. Although I have only been working in IT for a few years I have experience in the following:</p>

				<li>Storage and Backups</li>
				<li>Server Monitoring</li>
				<li>Unix Servers</li>
				<li>Oracle WebLogic</li>
			</ul>					
			<p class="interests"> When not working or doing school work I enjoy playing video games and playing board games. I also enjoy fishing, disc golf, and vacationing in the Upper Peninsula.</p>
